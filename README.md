# tasbih
A Python GUI tasbih program to keep track of your dhikr count on a PC.

## Requirements
This program requires Python >= 3.6 with Tkinter, which comes bundled by default in the installer. But if you encounter an ImportError for tkinter, then uninstall your existing Python installation and install the latest version of Python. During installation, go into the Optional Features and ensure that all options are ticked, especially **tcl/tk and IDLE**. Audio beeping to signal that the user has finished the dhikr is supported only by Windows PCs as it requires the Winsound library. If you have any ideas on how something similar can be achieved on Macintosh, feel free to hit me up with your ideas.

## Usage
Double click on the file to run the program directly. Alternatively, open Command Prompt / Terminal and run with the usual command:
`python counter_gui.pyw`
